# Steps To Run

- Ensure you have mongodb installed and running a cluster.

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:
- Email: `hradmin@test.com`
- Password: `TestPass1234`
